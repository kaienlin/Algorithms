## Problem Description

[Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen's website](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f108-ada/doc/ada19-hw4.pdf)

## TA's Hint

+ There are many different approaches that can solve this problem. You can try the following ways (or combine some of them):
    - alpha-beta pruning
    - Monte Carlo simulation
    - heuristic algorithms based on human knowledge

## Concept

+ assign each possible move a weight by some heuristics
+ choose the move with highest weight
+ my heuristics is bad and the code is ugly, please don't read it

## Code
```cpp
{{ code_from_file('src/courses/ada-fall-2019/hw4/pD.cpp') }}
```
