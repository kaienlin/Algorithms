[Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen's website](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f108-ada/doc/ada19-hw4.pdf)

## TA's Hint

+ The problem is NP-Complete. Apply fast algorithm to solve it.

## Concept

+ Reduce to *Maximum Clique Problem* (consider the matrix an "adjancy matrix")
+ *MaxCliqueDyn* Algorithm (original paper was published in 2007)

## Code
```cpp
{{ code_from_file('src/courses/ada-fall-2019/hw4/pC.cpp') }}
```
