# Computer Science Note

The documentation in this site is for:

+ organize my knowledge more structurally 
+ create a better view of what I have learned

## [Courses](./courses/index.md)

This area mostly contains homework assignments, sometimes with some class notes.

## [Algorithms](./algorithms/index.md)

My own implementation of some algorithms, mainly in C++.
